# Documentation & Resource References

- This project builds on Dhyey's work from the Optimization course at Amherst College, where he explored its applications in the Quantitative Trading industry from various perspectives. The directory contains open-source materials curated by Dhyey during Fall 2022 and Winter 2023, under the guidance of Professor Tanya Leise. The Amherst College Quant Club project team has since expanded upon this foundation, adding further functionality.
